# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a Machine Learning-based project designed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

With the rapid growth of digital payments, financial fraud has become a major concern. This project aims to build an intelligent classification model that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions using historical transaction data.

The model is trained on a highly imbalanced dataset and focuses on improving fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false positives.
